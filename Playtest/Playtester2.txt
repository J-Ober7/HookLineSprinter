Art and Lightning
    Was the lighting in the world too dark or too bright?
	I thought overall the lighting looked pretty good, I didn't have any issues with it.
    What did you think of the overall look of the game?
	I think the fishing aesthetic is really unique and goofy, I think the viewmodels and everything were very good and fitting. The level geometry itself was pretty simple but looked clean - it might help to have more variation in color and whatnot and maybe change up themes for different levels. Crosshair looked a little rough.
